# Examples
This repository contains examples, tutorials, and other scripts to demonstrate how to do things in CASA. 

## Organization
All material provided by the community and CASA collaborators should be placed in the **community** folder.  Follow the *\_template.ipynb* file for the proper structure.

The contents of this folder are automatically parsed to html and linked from the main [casadocs documentation](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Colab
All scripts should be in Jupyter notebook format through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  This ensures the entire community can execute the code in the same environment.  The Colab environment is integrated with GitHub and will allow direct saving of new notebooks in to this repository (after you have been granted write access).
